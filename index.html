        <h2>A Journey from MUN to ...</h2>

        <div class="journey">
            <p>📍 <strong>Day 1: The Moment That Started It All</strong></p>
            <p>I still remember the first time I saw you at MUN, confidently asking a question. I fumbled, and you giggled. Maybe I lost my case that day, but I think I started losing my heart too.</p>

            <p>📍 <strong>Day 2: The First Conversation</strong></p>
            <p>The next day, we talked. It wasn’t just small talk; it felt like I’d known you forever. My role as "China" didn’t matter anymore—getting to know you did.</p>

            <p>📍 <strong>The Chairperson’s Question</strong></p>
            <p>"Are you both dating?"—That one moment when the entire committee turned towards us. We laughed it off, but deep down, I wished it wasn’t just a joke.</p>

            <p>📍 <strong>The Tag That Stuck: 'Senior Sahab'</strong></p>
            <p>A title I never asked for, but now, I don’t want to lose. Every time you say it, it does something to me.</p>

            <p>📍 <strong>The Jealousy Moment</strong></p>
            <p>That day, when you said, "I have to meet that friend today," I don’t know why, but something in me shifted. Maybe I was jealous, maybe I just realized something bigger.</p>

            <p>📍 <strong>And Today...</strong></p>
            <p>Now, here I am, writing this, knowing that maybe you haven’t even thought about these moments the way I have. But I had to say it.</p>

        <h2>💌 The Confession</h2>
        <p>"So here it is. The resolution is drafted. China votes 'For the Motion' raised by the Chairperson. Just waiting for France to respond."</p>

        <a href="javascript:alert('China is waiting for France's vote!');" class="cta">What's Your Vote?</a>
